Style Your Web Apps and Office & SharePoint Add-ins with the Office UI Fabric
==========================================================
Developers, what is one of our top things we hate to do? Train the users of our applications, right? Well if you are building web applications for Office 365 users or Office Add-ins or SharePoint Add-ins, why not use the same design language in your applications that Microsoft uses! In this session you will learn about the Office UI Fabric, a design package provided by Microsoft that you can use to make your applications look and behave just like Office 365, Office and SharePoint. This will reduce the amount of training you have to do with your users and give them a clean & consistent experience!
